## Project Description

RoseTunes is an online blog that allows its readers to discover new women-centric music emphasizing women’s experiences, perspectives, and stories. As undergraduate computer science students, this project is important to us because we want our work to have a positive impact on future generations and the world around us. Women have historically been underrepresented in the music industry with instances ranging from lack of credit in their songwriting to gender-based objectification or harassment. Our goal is to celebrate the artistry of women as talented producers, songwriters, singers, and musicians.

## Project Features

Our landing page introduces our team and the inspiration behind this blog-style site which promotes women empowerment and musical talent. We highlight influential singers on our “top female artists” page and feature tracks with inspiring lyricism or beats on our “empowerment” page. Readers can discover up-and-coming female artists in our “hidden gems” page.
